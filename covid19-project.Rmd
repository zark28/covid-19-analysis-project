#COVIG-19 DATA PROJECT

## Setting up environment
Notes: setting up my environment by clearing previous variable  and loading `Hmics` and covid-19 data set
Link to data set [COVID19_line_list_data.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/versions/25?resource=download)

```{r loading packages}
install.packages("Hmisc")
library(Hmisc)
data <- read.csv("C:/Users/raswe/Downloads/Compressed/archive_1/COVID19_line_list_data.csv")
```

## Cleaning of covid-19 data set

```{r cleaning data set}

data$death_dummy<- as.integer(data$death !=0)

View(data$death_dummy)
```

## Finding death rate

```{r death rate for covid-19}
sum(data$death_dummy)/ nrow(data)
```

## Hypothesis: people who die from covid-19 are older than people who survive 

``` {r find the stats for dead and alive groups}
dead=subset(data,death_dummy==1)
alive=subset(data,death_dummy==0)
```

### Find the mean ages of the groups 
```{r find the mean for ages}
mean(dead$age, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(alive$age, na.rm = TRUE)
```
### Test if the results statistically significant?
```{r test for significance in age representation}
t.test(alive$age,dead$age, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.95)
```

### Conclusion on age varible effect on covid-19 deaths
we can say with 95% confidence:people who die are much older than those alive
if p-value< 0.5 , we reject the null hypothesis.
this means our results are statistically significant since p-value = 0 < 0.5


## Hypothesis: gender has no effect on the death rate 

``` {find the stats for the various groups}
men=subset(data,gender=="male")
women=subset(data,gender=="female")
```

### Find the mean deaths for the groups
```{r fining mean for deaths}
mean(men$death_dummy, na.rm = TRUE)
mean(women$death_dummy, na.rm = TRUE)
```
### Test if the results statistically significant?
```{r test for significance in gender representation}
t.test(men$death_dummy,women$death_dummy, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.99)
```

### Conclusion on gender varible effect on covid-19 deaths
99% confidence :men have from 0.8% to 8.8% chance higher of dying
p-value = 0.002 < 0.5 , so results are statistically significant 
Means men have a higher death rate that women in this population sample and it is a true
representation of the population
